# ZedExams Teacher Tools — Architecture & Technical Blueprint

**Step 2 of 3.** Builds on `TEACHER_TOOLS_STRATEGY.md` (Step 1). Covers: data model, security rules, Cloud Function signatures, the Zambian CBC lesson-plan schema, prompt-template system, CBC knowledge-base format, rate limiting, export pipeline, frontend routing, and admin playground. This document is the implementation contract for Step 3 (the MVP prototype).

---

## 1. Assumptions locked in from Step 1

- Teacher tools live at `zedexams.com/teachers/*` under the same auth and Firestore database.
- Teacher access is gated by the existing `teacherApplications` approval flow. A user's `role` must equal `"teacher"` or `"admin"` to use generation endpoints.
- AI backend is Claude, with model routing between Sonnet 4.5 (heavy tasks) and Haiku 4.5 (light tasks).
- Pricing: Free (5 lesson plans, 3 worksheets, 3 teacher notes / month), Pro (Individual) K79/mo or K790/yr, Max (School) K199/mo or K1,990/yr.
- Mobile money via the existing `momoService.js`; subscription status stored on the existing `users` document (extended with teacher-plan fields).

## 2. Data model — Firestore additions

All new collections are additive to the existing `users`, `teacherApplications`, `quizzes`, `lessons`, `papers`, `results`, `payments` collections. No existing collection changes shape.

### 2.1 `aiGenerations/{generationId}`

The canonical record of every AI generation. One document per generation, regardless of tool.

```
aiGenerations/{generationId}
├── ownerUid: string                    // auth UID of the teacher
├── tool: "lesson_plan" | "worksheet" | "flashcards" | "quiz" | "rubric" | "scheme_of_work"
├── inputs: object                      // normalized user inputs (see 2.1.1)
├── output: object                      // tool-specific structured output (see §4, §5, §6)
├── outputText: string                  // raw Claude response as JSON string (for reproducibility)
├── modelUsed: "claude-sonnet-4-5" | "claude-haiku-4-5"
├── promptVersion: string               // e.g. "lesson_plan.v3"
├── kbVersion: string                   // e.g. "cbc-kb-2026-04"
├── tokensIn: number
├── tokensOut: number
├── costUsdCents: number                // computed from model + tokens
├── status: "generating" | "complete" | "failed" | "flagged"
├── errorMessage: string | null
├── createdAt: timestamp
├── completedAt: timestamp | null
├── teacherEdited: boolean              // set true once teacher saves edits
├── exportedFormats: string[]           // e.g. ["pdf", "docx"] — grows over time
└── visibility: "private" | "shared_to_school" | "public_marketplace"
```

#### 2.1.1 Normalized `inputs` shape (per tool)

All tools share a common input envelope plus tool-specific fields:

```
inputs: {
  grade: "ECE" | "G1" | ... | "G12",
  subject: string,                     // slug from curriculum, e.g. "mathematics"
  topic: string,
  subtopic: string | null,
  durationMinutes: number | null,      // lesson plan only
  language: "english" | "bemba" | "nyanja" | "tonga" | "lozi" | "kaonde" | "lunda" | "luvale",
  // tool-specific:
  count: number | null,                // worksheet questions, flashcard cards
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard" | "mixed",
  instructions: string | null          // free-text teacher override, ≤500 chars
}
```

### 2.2 `teacherLibraries/{uid}/items/{itemId}`

A teacher's saved library — references generations they've chosen to keep.

```
teacherLibraries/{uid}/items/{itemId}
├── generationId: string                // FK into aiGenerations
├── tool: string
├── title: string                       // teacher-editable
├── grade: string
├── subject: string
├── topic: string
├── tags: string[]                      // teacher-assigned
├── folderId: string | null             // for library organization
├── pinned: boolean
├── lastOpenedAt: timestamp
└── createdAt: timestamp
```

### 2.3 `teacherLibraries/{uid}/folders/{folderId}`

Simple folder tree (one level deep for MVP).

```
teacherLibraries/{uid}/folders/{folderId}
├── name: string
├── color: string                       // hex code
├── createdAt: timestamp
└── itemCount: number                   // denormalized; updated by a CF trigger
```

### 2.4 `usageMeters/{uid}/periods/{yyyymm}`

Monthly usage counters for rate limiting and billing reconciliation. Document ID is the period key (e.g. `202604` for April 2026).

```
usageMeters/{uid}/periods/{yyyymm}
├── uid: string
├── periodStart: timestamp
├── periodEnd: timestamp
├── counters: {
│   lesson_plan: number,
│   worksheet: number,
│   flashcards: number,
│   quiz: number,
│   rubric: number,
│   scheme_of_work: number
│ }
├── limits: {                           // snapshot of limits at period start
│   lesson_plan: number,
│   worksheet: number,
│   flashcards: number,
│   quiz: number,
│   rubric: number,
│   scheme_of_work: number
│ }
├── plan: "free" | "individual" | "school"
├── totalCostUsdCents: number
└── updatedAt: timestamp
```

### 2.5 `cbcKnowledgeBase/{kbVersion}` + subcollections

Versioned grounding data injected into prompts. Admin-only writable; cached client-side.

```
cbcKnowledgeBase/{kbVersion}
├── version: string                     // e.g. "2026-04"
├── publishedAt: timestamp
├── isActive: boolean                   // only one at a time
├── sourceNote: string                  // e.g. "CDC syllabus PDFs 2023 + teacher review round 1"
└── notes: string

cbcKnowledgeBase/{kbVersion}/topics/{topicId}
├── grade: string
├── subject: string
├── term: 1 | 2 | 3
├── topic: string
├── subtopics: string[]
├── specificOutcomes: string[]          // CBC "Specific Outcomes"
├── keyCompetencies: string[]
├── values: string[]
├── suggestedMaterials: string[]
└── ecSampleQuestions: string[] | null  // seeded from past papers where available
```

### 2.6 `promptTemplates/{toolId}/versions/{versionId}`

Versioned prompt templates. Admin-only writable.

```
promptTemplates/{toolId}
├── toolId: "lesson_plan" | "worksheet" | ...
├── activeVersionId: string
└── updatedAt: timestamp

promptTemplates/{toolId}/versions/{versionId}
├── versionId: string                   // e.g. "v3"
├── systemPrompt: string
├── userPromptTemplate: string          // Handlebars-style {{placeholders}}
├── jsonSchema: object                  // output JSON schema (validated post-call)
├── defaultModel: "claude-sonnet-4-5" | "claude-haiku-4-5"
├── createdBy: string                   // admin uid
├── createdAt: timestamp
└── notes: string
```

### 2.7 `schoolLicences/{licenceId}`

School-tier licences for Phase 1.5+ (not MVP, but schema locked now to avoid migration).

```
schoolLicences/{licenceId}
├── schoolName: string
├── contactName: string
├── contactEmail: string
├── contactPhone: string
├── adminUid: string                    // principal/head teacher's account
├── seatLimit: number
├── seatsUsed: number
├── memberUids: string[]
├── plan: "school_small" | "school_medium" | "school_large"
├── priceKwacha: number
├── paidUntil: timestamp
├── createdAt: timestamp
└── status: "active" | "expired" | "suspended"
```

### 2.8 Extensions to existing `users/{uid}`

Add fields (all optional; no rule changes needed beyond allowing admin to set them):

```
users/{uid} (additions)
├── teacherPlan: "free" | "individual" | "school" | null
├── teacherPlanExpiresAt: timestamp | null
├── teacherPlanActivatedAt: timestamp | null
├── schoolLicenceId: string | null
└── teacherMonthlyGenerationsOverride: number | null  // admin override for special cases
```

## 3. Security rules — additions

Add to `firestore.rules` inside the root `match /databases/{database}/documents` block. These keep your existing patterns (role checks, `isTeacherOrAbove`, etc.).

```javascript
// ── aiGenerations ─────────────────────────────────────────
match /aiGenerations/{genId} {
  allow read:   if isAuthed() && (resource.data.ownerUid == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
  // Only Cloud Functions should create these (use the admin SDK), so deny client writes.
  allow create: if false;
  allow update: if isAuthed()
                   && resource.data.ownerUid == request.auth.uid
                   && changedKeys().hasOnly(['teacherEdited', 'visibility', 'exportedFormats']);
  allow delete: if isAuthed() && (resource.data.ownerUid == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
}

// ── teacherLibraries ──────────────────────────────────────
match /teacherLibraries/{uid} {
  allow read: if isAuthed() && (isOwner(uid) || isAdmin());
  match /items/{itemId} {
    allow read, write, delete: if isAuthed() && isOwner(uid);
  }
  match /folders/{folderId} {
    allow read, write, delete: if isAuthed() && isOwner(uid);
  }
}

// ── usageMeters ───────────────────────────────────────────
match /usageMeters/{uid} {
  allow read: if isAuthed() && (isOwner(uid) || isAdmin());
  match /periods/{periodId} {
    allow read:  if isAuthed() && (isOwner(uid) || isAdmin());
    allow write: if false;   // only Cloud Functions write these
  }
}

// ── cbcKnowledgeBase ──────────────────────────────────────
match /cbcKnowledgeBase/{version} {
  allow read:  if isAuthed();
  allow write: if isAdmin();
  match /topics/{topicId} {
    allow read:  if isAuthed();
    allow write: if isAdmin();
  }
}

// ── promptTemplates ───────────────────────────────────────
match /promptTemplates/{toolId} {
  allow read:  if isAdmin();   // never exposed to non-admin clients
  allow write: if isAdmin();
  match /versions/{versionId} {
    allow read, write: if isAdmin();
  }
}

// ── schoolLicences ────────────────────────────────────────
match /schoolLicences/{licenceId} {
  allow read:   if isAuthed() && (request.auth.uid in resource.data.memberUids || isAdmin());
  allow write:  if isAdmin();
}
```

## 4. The Zambian CBC Lesson Plan schema

This is the canonical output shape for the Lesson Plan Generator. It reflects the CDC's lesson-plan format: administrative header, outcomes, competencies, values, prerequisite knowledge, materials, a three-phase body (Introduction / Development / Conclusion) with matching pupil and teacher activities, assessment, and reflection.

```json

    "whatWentWell": "",
    "whatToImprove": "",
    "pupilsWhoNeedFollowUp": []
  }
}
```

The `teacherReflection` section is intentionally left blank — the teacher fills it in after teaching. Fields with Zambian-specific terminology (`termAndWeek`, `numberOfPupils`, `Lowest Common Denominator`) keep the document feeling authentic to Zambian heads of department who review these.

## 5. Worksheet schema

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "header": {
    "title": "Grade 5 Mathematics — Adding Fractions (Unlike Denominators)",

## 6. Flashcard schema

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "title": "Grade 5 — Fractions: Key Terms",
  "grade": "Grade 5",
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "topic": "Fractions",
  "cards": [
    {

    },
    {
      "front": "What is the LCD?",
      "back": "The Lowest Common Denominator — the smallest number that both denominators divide into evenly.",
      "example": "The LCD of 1/4 and 1/6 is 12.",
      "hint": "It is also the LCM of the two denominators."
    }
  ]
}
```

## 7. Prompt-template system

### 7.1 File layout

```
functions/
  prompts/
    lesson_plan/
      v1.json
      v2.json
      v3.json        ← default active version
    worksheet/
      v1.json
      v2.json        ← default
    flashcards/
      v1.json        ← default
    shared/
      cbc_preamble.md
      safety_guardrails.md
```

### 7.2 Prompt document shape (each `vN.json`)

```json
{
  "versionId": "v3",
  "defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "fallbackModel": "claude-haiku-4-5",
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "maxTokens": 4000,
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert Zambian Grade {{grade}} teacher...",
  "userPromptTemplate": "Generate a lesson plan for {{subject}} ...",
  "outputJsonSchema": { "$ref": "#/schemas/lesson_plan_v1" }
}
```

At generation time: load the active prompt version, inject CBC knowledge-base entries for the requested grade/subject/topic as a grounding block, render the Handlebars template, call Claude, validate the JSON output against the schema, store everything.

### 7.3 Active version resolution

A small in-memory cache in the Cloud Function process reads `promptTemplates/{toolId}.activeVersionId` on cold start and every 5 minutes. Changing the active version in Firestore is how you roll out a new prompt without a deploy.

## 8. CBC knowledge base — how to build and inject it

The single most important quality lever you have. Without this, Claude invents Zambian-looking but wrong topic names. With it, Claude grounds every generation in real CDC-syllabus topics.

**Sourcing** (for v1 of the KB):
- CDC primary and junior-secondary syllabi (PDFs)
- CDC senior-secondary two-tier framework documents
- ECZ past-paper topic-frequency analysis from your existing `papers` collection
- A human review pass by one Zambian teacher per subject band (Primary, Junior Sec, Senior Sec)

**Storage** in Firestore under `cbcKnowledgeBase/{version}/topics/*` per the schema in 2.5.

**Injection at prompt time**:

```
<cbc_context grade="5" subject="mathematics" topic="Fractions">
Official sub-topics: Equivalent Fractions; Adding Fractions (Like); Adding Fractions (Unlike);
  Subtracting Fractions; Multiplying Fractions by Whole Numbers; Word Problems with Fractions.
Key Competencies typically applied: Critical thinking, Numeracy, Communication.
Values emphasised: Accuracy, Perseverance, Cooperation.
Reference: Zambia Grade 5 Mathematics Pupil's Book (CDC), pages 48–62.
</cbc_context>
```

The Cloud Function looks up the exact topic document and injects it verbatim. If the teacher's requested topic is not found, the function returns a friendly "That topic is not in the Grade 5 Mathematics syllabus — did you mean one of these?" with suggestions, rather than silently hallucinating.

## 9. Cloud Function signatures

Add to `/functions/index.js`. All are HTTPS-callable (auth'd via Firebase Auth on the client).

```javascript
// Generation
exports.generateLessonPlan   = onCall({secrets: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]}, async (req) => { ... });
exports.generateWorksheet    = onCall({secrets: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]}, async (req) => { ... });
exports.generateFlashcards   = onCall({secrets: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]}, async (req) => { ... });

// Library
exports.saveToLibrary        = onCall(async (req) => { ... });
exports.deleteFromLibrary    = onCall(async (req) => { ... });
exports.regenerateSection    = onCall({secrets: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]}, async (req) => { ... });

// Export
exports.exportToPdf          = onCall(async (req) => { ... });
exports.exportToDocx         = onCall(async (req) => { ... });

// Admin
exports.adminSeedKb          = onCall(async (req) => { ... });
exports.adminPromptPlayground = onCall({secrets: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]}, async (req) => { ... });
```

Each generation function follows the same flow:

```
1. Verify auth + role ∈ {teacher, admin}.
2. Validate `inputs` against the tool's input schema.
3. Read user's usageMeter for the current period; create if missing.
4. Check counter < limit for this tool on user's plan. If not → throw PRECONDITION_FAILED.
5. Look up CBC KB entry for {grade, subject, topic}. If missing → suggest close matches.
6. Load active prompt template version.
7. Render prompt with inputs + KB context.
8. Route model: Sonnet for lesson_plan/worksheet, Haiku for flashcards.
9. Call Claude Messages API with tool-use for structured JSON output.
10. Validate response against the output JSON schema.
11. In a transaction: increment usageMeter counter, create aiGeneration doc, return generationId + output.
12. On any error: log, mark generation as failed, return friendly error to client.

## 10. Rate limiting and usage metering

Rate limits are enforced **server-side only** (client UI mirrors them for UX but never gates — a client-only check is a subscription-bypass vulnerability).

Implementation:

```javascript
// Pseudo-code inside each generation function
const period = yyyymm(now);
const meterRef = db.doc(`usageMeters/${uid}/periods/${period}`);

await db.runTransaction(async (tx) => {
  const meter = (await tx.get(meterRef)).data() || seedMeter(uid, period);
  const used  = meter.counters[tool] || 0;
  const limit = meter.limits[tool];
  if (used >= limit) {
    throw new HttpsError("failed-precondition", "quota-exceeded", {tool, used, limit});
  }
  tx.set(meterRef, {
    ...meter,
    counters: {...meter.counters, [tool]: used + 1},
    updatedAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
  }, {merge: true});
});
```

Plan → limits mapping (matches marketing copy in `src/components/marketing/Plans.jsx`):

| Tool            | Free | Individual (Pro) | School (Max, per teacher) |
|-----------------|------|------------------|----------------------------|
| lesson_plan     | 5    | 40               | 200 (fair-use)             |
| worksheet       | 3    | 25               | 200 (fair-use)             |
| notes           | 3    | 25               | 200 (fair-use)             |
| flashcards      | 20   | 200              | 200                        |
| quiz            | 0    | 8                | 200 (fair-use)             |
| rubric          | 0    | 8                | 200 (fair-use)             |
| scheme_of_work  | 0    | 2                | 200 (fair-use)             |

Free users see assessments (`quiz`, `rubric`) and `scheme_of_work` as locked
features — the gate raises `failed-precondition` immediately, which the
frontend maps to the `feature-locked` paywall scenario.

Admins can override via `users.teacherMonthlyGenerationsOverride` for special cases.

## 11. Export pipeline

Two paths:

**DOCX** — client-side using the `docx` npm package. A `lessonPlanToDocx(generationObject)` function walks the JSON and emits a Word document styled to match a typical Zambian lesson-plan template (bordered tables, CDC-style section headings). Fast (≤200ms), zero server cost, works offline.

**PDF** — server-side using a `renderToPdf` Cloud Function that uses Puppeteer (already in your Firebase Functions environment as a dependency option). It renders a React/HTML template to Chromium and returns a PDF. Slower (~2s) and costs a Function invocation, but produces consistent output.

File naming convention:
```
{teacher-name-slug}_{grade}_{subject}_{topic-slug}_{date}.docx
```

Stored in Firebase Storage under `teacher-exports/{uid}/{generationId}.{ext}` for redownload. Retention: 30 days, then auto-deleted via a scheduled function.

## 12. Frontend routing — additions to `src/App.jsx`

```
/teachers                      — Teacher dashboard (library, stats, upgrade CTA)
/teachers/generate/lesson-plan — Lesson Plan Generator
/teachers/generate/worksheet   — Worksheet Generator
/teachers/generate/flashcards  — Flashcard Generator
/teachers/library              — Saved generations (search, filter, folder view)
/teachers/library/:itemId      — Detail view (read, edit, export, regenerate)
/teachers/settings             — Teacher profile + plan
/teachers/upgrade              — Pricing / plan selection (reuses your Flutterwave/MoMo flow)
/admin/prompts                 — Admin: prompt playground (role=admin gated)
/admin/kb                      — Admin: CBC knowledge-base editor
/admin/metrics                 — Admin: usage + cost dashboards
```

## 13. Component tree — additions under `src/components/teacher/`

```

## 14. Admin prompt playground

A single admin page at `/admin/prompts` that lets you:
- Pick a tool (lesson_plan / worksheet / flashcards).
- Pick the current active version and one or more older versions.
- Enter a test input (grade, subject, topic, etc.).
- Run all selected versions against the same input in parallel.
- See a side-by-side diff of the outputs.
- Promote a non-active version to active with one click.

Build this in Phase 1. It pays for itself in the first prompt change.

## 15. Observability and cost tracking

Log every generation to an `aiGenerationsMetrics` **BigQuery sink** (via Firebase's built-in BigQuery export, free to set up). Daily aggregates via a scheduled function:

```
- generations per tool per day
- average tokens in/out per tool
- cost per generation (computed from modelUsed + tokens)
- free-tier-exhaustion rate per cohort
- tool-to-export rate per user
- failure rate by error code
```

Surface on `/admin/metrics`. These are the numbers you'll need to make Phase 2 prioritization decisions.

## 16. Implementation order for Step 3 (MVP build)

1. **Data & rules**: Add the new Firestore collections + security-rule block. Deploy rules.
2. **Prompt templates**: Commit `v1` prompts for lesson_plan, worksheet, flashcards. Seed `promptTemplates/*` in Firestore.
3. **CBC KB**: Seed a minimum viable KB — Grades 1–7 × core subjects (Mathematics, English, Integrated Science, Social Studies, Literacy, Zambian Language). Senior secondary comes later.
4. **Cloud Functions**: `generateLessonPlan` first (highest-value tool), then `generateWorksheet`, then `generateFlashcards`. Deploy + test each with Postman before touching the frontend.
5. **Frontend generators**: `LessonPlanGenerator` first — full round trip including export. Then Worksheet, then Flashcards.
6. **Library**: Dashboard, grid, detail view, folder support.
7. **Rate limiting**: wired into the Functions from step 4; UI meters in step 5/6.
8. **Admin playground**: last, but before first public beta.

## 17. Open questions for Step 3

Before I write the code, I need your answers on:

1. **Prompt-template seed language** — English-only for v1, or also seed Bemba / Nyanja templates from day one?
2. **Export default** — DOCX first (teachers edit before printing) or PDF first (print-ready)?
3. **Lesson-plan length preset** — default to 40-minute single lesson, or offer 40 / 60 / 80-minute presets?
4. **Streaming UI** — use Claude's SSE streaming so the teacher sees the plan build in real time, or wait for the full response (simpler, 3–8s spinner)?
5. **Beta cohort access** — gated invite codes for the first 20 teachers, or public free tier immediately?

Answer those five and I'll move into Step 3 — the working MVP prototype.
